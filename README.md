### What I learned
This code was intersting to us and taught us how we can create the snap scroll effect that allows content to take up a whole page and well, snap scroll.

```css
section {
    scroll-snap-align: start;
    scroll-snap-stop: always;
    display: flex;
  }
  section:nth-of-type(even) {
    color: white;
    background: black;
  }
  
  section:nth-of-type(odd) {
    color: black;
    background: white;
  }

```
